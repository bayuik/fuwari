# About

## Hello, I'm Bayu Indra Kusuma

Software Developer with over 3 years of experience specializing in Odoo ERP development. Leverage my proficiency in JavaScript and Python to deliver efficient business solutions across Human Resources, Purchase, Sales, Material Requirements Planning and Property Management. Fluent in Indonesian (native) and English, I collaborate effectively with business analysts to design and implement high-quality ERP systems.

I believe that as humans, we naturally have a tendency to pursue freedom. One form of this freedom is the ability to do what we love, including learning for the sheer joy of it, not for financial gain. That’s why I often enjoy exploring technologies unrelated to my work—it’s a hobby that fuels my curiosity and reflects this pursuit of freedom.
