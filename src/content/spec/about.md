# About

## Hello, I'm Bayu Indra Kusuma

Odoo Specialist with 4+ years of experience developing end-to-end ERP solutions. Expertise in Python and JavaScript for building custom modules in HR, Purchasing, Sales, MRP, and Property Management. Strong track record in API integrations, performance optimization, and user training. Bilingual (Native Indonesian, Professional English) with proven ability to bridge technical and business requirements. Passionate about creating scalable systems that drive operational efficiency.

I believe that as humans, we naturally have a tendency to pursue freedom. One form of this freedom is the ability to do what we love, including learning for the sheer joy of it, not for financial gain. That’s why I often enjoy exploring technologies unrelated to my work—it’s a hobby that fuels my curiosity and reflects this pursuit of freedom.
